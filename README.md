# Project Platen Cookies

Version 2013.04.30

This extension adds cookies from a Project Platen book into the param pool. I suggest including the [Globalparamloader](symphonyextensions.com/extensions/globalparamloader/) extension to add the parameters to all pages.

Javascript for using creating the parameters is in the [Project Platen workspace](https://github.com/ayellowraven/workspace).
